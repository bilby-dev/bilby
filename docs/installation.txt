Installation
============

The lastest stable release of Tupak can be `pip-installed
<https://pypi.org/project/TUPAK/>`_ from

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install tupak

If you would like to install the development version, see the instructions
below.

Install tupak from source
-------------------------

:code:`tupak` is developed to work with both Python 2.7+ and Python 3+. In the
following, we assume you have a working python installation, `python pip
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing)>`_,
and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_. See :ref:`installing-python` for our
advise on installing anaconda python.

Clone the repository, install the requirements, and then install the software:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone git@git.ligo.org:Monash/tupak.git
   $ cd tupak/
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install -r optional_requirements.txt
   $ python setup.py install

Once you have run these steps, you have :code:`tupak` installed. You can now try to
run the examples. You should install the `optional_requirements.txt` if you
plan to use `tupak` for gravitational wave inference.

.. note::
   If you do not have a git.ligo account, and recieve and error message:

   .. code-block:: console

      git@git.ligo.org: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
      fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

   Then you need to use the HTTPS URL, e.g. replace the first line above with

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://git.ligo.org/Monash/tupak.git

.. _installing-python:

Installing python
-----------------

Most computers/clusters have a system installed python version. You may choose
to use this, but here we describe an alternative. In particular, how to install
the `anaconda distribution python package
<https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`_. Firstly, download the install
file, you can do this from the link above, or run the command

.. code-block:: console

   $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

this will download an installer for python 3.6, for other versions check
the `anaconda page <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`_.
Then, `run the command
<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/linux.html>`_

.. code-block:: console

   $ bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

and follow the prompts on the install screen.  After this process, you should
have a directory :code:`~/anaconda3` in your home directory. This contains your
python installation. In particular, if you run the command

.. code-block:: console

   $ which python
   /home/users/USER/anaconda3/bin/python

The output here (with a suitable replacement of the path) indicates that you
are using the anaconda install of python. If instead, the output says something
like :code;`/usr/bin/python`, then this is not the anaconda installation, but
instead the system python.

If you are finding that you have run the above steps, but :code:`python` is
not pointing to your anaconda install, make sure that (a) you have appended a
line like this to your :code:`.bashrc` file

.. code-block:: console

   export PATH="${HOME}/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

and (b) that you have restarted bash for this line to take effect (i.e., run
:code:`$ bash`).

.. note::

    Using your own installation of python has several advantages: its generally
    easier to debug, avoids conflicts with other packages, and if you end up
    with a broken installation you can just delete the directory and start
    again.


Installing lalsuite
-------------------

For many gravitational-wave related examples you'll need access to the
`lalsuite <https://wiki.ligo.org/DASWG/LALSuite>`_ tool set. These should be
installed by default in the requirements. However, if you have problems with
your installation, you can first try to install the simple way:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install lalsuite.

If this doesn't work, or you prefer to, you can also install from source.

First, head to https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite to check you have an
account and SSH keys set up. Then,

.. code-block:: console

   $ git lfs install # you may need to install git-lfs first
   $ git clone git@git.ligo.org:lscsoft/lalsuite.git
   $ cd lalsuite
   $ ./00boot
   $ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/lalsuite-install --disable-all-lal --enable-swig  --enable-lalsimulation
   $ make; make install

Warning: in the configure line here, we have disabled everything except
lalsimulation. If you need other modules, see `./configure --help`.

Installing pymultinest
----------------------

If you want to use the `pymultinest` sampler, you first need the
MultiNest library to be installed to work properly. The full instructions can
be found here: https://johannesbuchner.github.io/PyMultiNest/install.html. Here
is a shortened version:

First, install the dependencies (for Ubuntu/Linux):

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install python-{scipy,numpy,matplotlib,progressbar} ipython libblas{3,-dev} liblapack{3,-dev} libatlas{3-base,-dev} cmake build-essential git gfortran

For Mac, the advice in the instructions are "If you google for “MultiNest Mac OSX” or “PyMultiNest Mac OSX” you will find installation instructions".

The following will place a directory `MultiNest` in your :code:`$HOME` directory, if you want
to place it somewhere, adjust the instructions as such.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest $HOME
   $ cd $HOME/MultiNest/build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make

Finally, add the libraries to you path. Add this to the `.bashrc` file

.. code-block:: console

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/Downloads/MultiNest/lib:

(you'll need to resource your `.bashrc` after this, i.e. run `bash`).

Common problems: multiple tupak versions
----------------------------------------

Occasionally, it is possible to end up with multiple tupak installations.
To diagnose this, run the following

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -c 'import tupak; print(tupak.__file__)'
   /home/user1/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tupak-0.2.10py3.6.egg/tupak/__init__.pyc

Here we can see it's installed under `site-packages` within anaconda. Your
installation path may differ. If you believe you have multiple installs, you
can verify this by running :code:`ls` in that directory. Then, you
can purge your installation of tupak by running

.. code-block:: console

   $ rm -r /home/user1/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tupak*

Replacing the path with the output of the previous command.
