Installation
============

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Conda

      .. code-block:: console

          $ conda install -c conda-forge bilby

      Supported python versions: 3.10-3.12.

   .. tab:: Pip

      .. code-block:: console

          $ pip install bilby

      Supported python versions: 3.10-3.12.


This will install all requirements for running :code:`bilby` for general
inference problems, including our default sampler `dynesty
<https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Other samplers will need to be
installed via pip or the appropriate means.

To install the requirements for running :code:`bilby.gw` for gravitational
wave inference, please additionally run the following commands.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Conda

      .. code-block:: console

          $ conda install -c conda-forge gwpy python-lalsimulation

   .. tab:: Pip

      .. code-block:: console

          $ pip install gwpy lalsuite


Install bilby from source
-------------------------

:code:`bilby` is developed and tested with Python 3.10-3.12. In the
following, we assume you have a working python installation, `python pip
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing)>`_,
and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_. See :ref:`installing-python` for our
advise on installing anaconda python.

Clone the repository, install the requirements, and then install the software:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone git@git@github.com:bilby-dev/bilby.git
   $ cd bilby/
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install .

Once you have run these steps, you have :code:`bilby` installed. You can now
try to run the examples.

.. note::
   The bilby version is determined by the tags in the git repository. Therefore, you may need to run

   .. code-block:: console

      git fetch --all --tags

   to fetch the tags so that when you install from source your version information is up to date. 

.. note::
   You may be use to using :code:`$ python setup.py install` to install software
   from source. While it is possible to do this, current recommentations from
   the python community (see, e.g. `this site <https://python3statement.org/practicalities/>`_
   are to use :code:`pip`. For development install, the :code:`-e` flag can be
   used.

Installing optional requirements
================================

The `requirements.txt
<https://github.com/bilby-dev/bilby/blob/main/requirements.txt>`_ is a
minimal set of requirements for using :code:`bilby`. Additionally, we provide:

1. The file `optional_requirements.txt
<https://github.com/bilby-dev/bilby/blob/main/optional_requirements.txt>`_
which you should install if you plan to use :code:`bilby` for
gravitational-wave data analysis.

2. By default, we only require the default sampler dynesty_ be installed. For
instructions on installing other samplers, see :ref:`Installing samplers`.

.. _installing-python:

Installing python
-----------------

Most computers/clusters have a system installed python version. You may choose
to use this, but here we describe an alternative. In particular, how to install
the `anaconda distribution python package
<https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`_. Firstly, download the install
file, you can do this from the link above, or run the command

.. code-block:: console

   $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

this will download a linux installer for python, for other versions check
the `anaconda page <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`_.
Then, `run the command
<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/linux.html>`_

.. code-block:: console

   $ bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

and follow the prompts on the install screen.  After this process, you should
have a directory :code:`~/anaconda3` in your home directory. This contains your
python installation. In particular, if you run the command

.. code-block:: console

   $ which python
   /home/users/USER/anaconda3/bin/python

The output here (with a suitable replacement of the path) indicates that you
are using the anaconda install of python. If instead, the output says something
like :code;`/usr/bin/python`, then this is not the anaconda installation, but
instead the system python.

If you are finding that you have run the above steps, but :code:`python` is
not pointing to your anaconda install, make sure that (a) you have appended a
line like this to your :code:`.bashrc` file

.. code-block:: console

   export PATH="${HOME}/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

and (b) that you have restarted bash for this line to take effect (i.e., run
:code:`$ bash`).

.. note::

    Using your own installation of python has several advantages: its generally
    easier to debug, avoids conflicts with other packages, and if you end up
    with a broken installation you can just delete the directory and start
    again.


Installing lalsuite
-------------------

For many gravitational-wave related examples you'll need access to the
`lalsuite <https://wiki.ligo.org/Computing/LALSuiteInstall>`_ tool set. These should be
installed by default in the requirements. However, if you have problems with
your installation, you can first try to install the simple way:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install lalsuite.

If this doesn't work, or you prefer to, you can also install from source.

First, head to https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite to check you have an
account and SSH keys set up. Then,

.. code-block:: console

   $ git lfs install # you may need to install git-lfs first
   $ git clone git@git.ligo.org:lscsoft/lalsuite.git
   $ cd lalsuite
   $ ./00boot
   $ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/lalsuite-install --disable-all-lal --enable-swig  --enable-lalsimulation
   $ make; make install

Warning: in the configure line here, we have disabled everything except
lalsimulation. If you need other modules, see `./configure --help`.

Common problems: multiple bilby versions
----------------------------------------

Occasionally, it is possible to end up with multiple bilby installations.
To diagnose this, run the following

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -c 'import bilby; print(bilby.__file__)'
   /home/user1/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bilby-0.2.10py3.6.egg/bilby/__init__.pyc

Here we can see it's installed under `site-packages` within anaconda. Your
installation path may differ. If you believe you have multiple installs, you
can verify this by running :code:`ls` in that directory. Then, you
can purge your installation of bilby by running

.. code-block:: console

   $ rm -r /home/user1/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bilby*

Replacing the path with the output of the previous command.
