Defining plugins
----------------

:code:`bilby` allows for additional customizations/extra features via plugins.
This allows users to add new functionality without the need to modify the main
:code:`bilby` codebase, for example to add a new sampler.

To make your plugins discoverable to :code:`bilby`, you need to specify a plugin
group (which :code:`bilby` knows to search for), a name for the plugin, and the
python path to your function/class within your package metadata, see `here
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/#using-package-metadata>`_
for details. For example, if you have a package called :code:`mypackage` and
you wish to add a plugin called :code:`my_awesome_plugin` within the group
:code:`bilby.plugin`, you would specify the following in your `pyproject.toml
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/>`_
file::

    [project.entry-points."bilby.plugin"]
    my_awesome_plugin = "mypackage.plugin"

Currently :code:`bilby` allows for the following plugin groups:

- :code:`"bilby.samplers"`: group for adding samplers to :code:`bilby`. See :ref:`Sampler plugins` for more details.


---------------
Sampler plugins
---------------

Sampler plugins can specified via the :code:`"bilby.samplers"` group and these
are automatically added to the 'known' samplers in :code:`bilby`.
This allows users to add support for new samplers without having to modify the
core :code:`bilby` codebase.
Sampler plugins should implement a sampler class that in inherits from one of
the following classes:

- :py:class:`bilby.core.sampler.base_sampler.Sampler`
- :py:class:`bilby.core.sampler.base_sampler.NestedSampler`
- :py:class:`bilby.core.sampler.base_sampler.MCMCSampler`

We provide a `template <https://github.com/bilby-plugins/sampler-template>`_
for creating sampler plugins on GitHub.

.. note::
    When implementing a new sampler plugin, please avoid using a generic name for
    the plugin (e.g. 'nest', 'mcmc') as this may lead to naming conflicts.


Sampler plugin library
----------------------

This is a list of known sampler plugins. if you don't see your plugin listed
here, we encourage you to open a
`pull request <https://github.com/bilby-dev/bilby/compare>`_ to add it.

- :code:`nessai-bilby`: https://github.com/bilby-dev/nessai-bilby
- :code:`pypolychord-bilby`: https://github.com/bilby-dev/pypolychord-bilby


Bilby-native samplers
---------------------

Some samplers are implemented directly in :code:`bilby` and these are avertised
under two possible names:

- :code:`bilby.<sampler name>`: always available, indicates the sampler is implemented in bilby,
- :code:`<sampler name>`: only refers to the native bilby implementation if an external plugin does not already provide this sampler.

This allows for an external plugin to provide a sampler without introducing
namespace conflicts.


--------------------------------
Information for bilby developers
--------------------------------

Using plugins within bilby
--------------------------

Within :code:`bilby`, plugins are discovered with the
:py:func:`bilby.core.utils.get_entry_points` function,
and can be used throughout the :code:`bilby` infrastructure.

Adding a new plugin group
-------------------------

If you want to add support for a new plugin group, please
`open an issue <https://github.com/bilby-dev/bilby/issues/new>`_
to discuss the details with other developers.
