Dynesty Guide
=============

The Dynesty sampler is just one of the samplers available in bilby, but it is
well-used and found to be fast and accurate. Here, we provide a short guide to
its implementation. This will not be a complete guide, additional help can be
found in the `Dynesty documentation <https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

All of the options discussed herein can be set in the :code:`bilby.run_sampler()`
call. For example, to set the number of live points to 1000

.. code-block:: python

   >>> bilby.run_sampler(likelihood, priors, sampler="dynesty", nlive=1000)

.. note::
   Bilby checks the kwargs input through run_sampler. If you miss-spell a word,
   you will see a warning "Supplied argument X not an argument of dynesty, removing."

Bilby-specific implementation details
-------------------------------------

In Bilby, we have implemented custom stepping methods for use within dynesty.
We have implemented three methods for performing an MCMC evolution to find a
new point from the constrained prior. These can be specified using the
:code:`sample` argument.

1. :code:`sample="act-walk"` (default): with this method, the MCMC evolution is
   performed until the autocorrelation length of the chain can be accurately determined.
   Following `this guide <https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/autocorr/>`_
   we run for 50 times the autocorrelation length. This chain is then thinned by
   a user-specified number of autocorrelation times :code:`nact` to yield a cache
   of :code:`N = 50 / nact` points. These points are then returned the next :code:`N`
   iterations of :code:`dynesty`. With this method, :code:`nact=2` often gives good
   results, however, in some cases, a larger value may be required.

2. :code:`sample="acceptance-walk"`: with this method, at each iteration all MCMC chains
   are set to the same length. The specific length evolves during the run so that the
   number of accepted steps follows a Poisson distribution with mean :code:`naccept`
   during each chain. This method is well
   suited to parallelised applications, as each MCMC chain will run for the same
   amount of time. The value of :code:`naccept` should be tuned based on the
   application. For example, one could run a single analysis with
   :code:`sample="act-walk"` to estimate a viable number of accepted steps.

3. :code:`sample="rwalk"`: this method is similar to the :code:`"acceptance-walk"`
   method, however, the adaptation of the MCMC length happens within the chain.
   This method is primarily included for historical reasons and was the default
   method prior to :code:`Bilby<2`. For this application, :code:`nact` is half
   the average accepted number of jumps per chain.

You can revert to the original dynesty implementation by specifying
:code:`sample="rwalk_dynesty"`.

There are a number of keyword arguments that influence these sampling methods:

#. :code:`nact/naccept` as described above, this varies based on the method.

#. :code:`maxmcmc`: the maximum number of walks to use. This naming is chosen
   for consistency with other codes. Default is 5000. If this limit is reached,
   a warning will be printed during sampling.

#. :code:`proposals`: a list of the desired proposals.
   Each of these proposals can be used with any of the sampling methods described
   above. The allowed values are

  * :code:`diff`: `ter Braak + (2006) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-006-8769-1>`_
    differential evolution. This is the default for :code:`bound="live"` and
    :code:`bound="live-multi"`.

  * :code:`volumetric`: sample from an ellipsoid centered on the current point.
    This is the proposal distribution implemented in :code:`dynesty` and the
    default for all other :code:`bound` options. This was the default proposal
    distribution for :code:`Bilby<2`, however, in many applications it leads to
    longer autocorrelation times and struggles to explore multi-modal distributions.

Finally, we implement two custom :code:`dynesty.sampler.Sampler` classes to
facilitate the differential evolution proposal and average acceptance tracking.

#. :code:`bound="live"` uses the :code:`LivePointSampler` which adapts the
   :code:`walks` to average :code:`naccept` accepted steps when in
   :code:`acceptance-walk` mode and passes the current live points to the
   sample method.

#. :code:`bound="live-multi"` combines the functionality of :code:`"live"` with
   the :code:`dynesty` implemented :code:`multi` method for multi-ellipsoid
   :code:`volumetric` sampling. This method is intended when using both the
   :code:`diff` and :code:`volumetric` proposals.

Understanding the output
------------------------

Before sampling begins, you will see a message like this

.. code-block:: console

   14:06 bilby INFO    : Single likelihood evaluation took 3.273e-03 s

This tells you that a typical likelihood evaluation takes a few milliseconds.
You can use this to gauge how long the run might take: if a typical likelihood
evaluation takes more than a fraction of a second, it is unlikely your run will
complete in a reasonable amount of time using serial bilby. After this, is a list
of all the kwargs passed in to dynesty. Note, where a :code:`None` is given,
dynesty will fill in its own defaults. The Bilby specific arguments are printed
on their onw. Then, we get a message about how often checkpointing will be done,
the version of dynesty, and which sample method will be used.

During the sampling, dynesty writes an update of its progress to the terminal
(specifally, this is writtent to STDOUT). Here is an example:


.. code-block:: console

   1015it [00:08, 138.49it/s, bound:0 nc:2 ncall:2714 eff:37.4% logz-ratio=-67.89+/-0.09 dlogz:181.166>0.10]

From left to right, this gives the number of iterations, the sampling time,
the iterations per second, the bound (while :code:`bound=0` dynesty samples
from the unit cube), the number of likelihood calls per sample :code:`nc`, the
total number of likelihood calls :code:`ncall`, the sampling efficiency, the
current estimate of the logz-ratio (monotonically increases) and the estimated
remaining log evidence.

If the likelihood calculates the :code:`log_noise_evidence`, then this output
will give the :code:`logz-ratio`. If it doesn't it instead uses just the
unnormalised evidence :code:`logz`.

The :code:`logz-ratio` and :code:`dlogz` gives an estimate of the final
expected evidence. You can compare this to your expectations to help diagnose
problems before completing a run. However, be aware the :code:`dlogz` does not
monotonically decrease: if a region of large likelihood is subsequently found,
the :code:`dlogz` will increase.

Diagnostic plots
----------------

At each checkpoint, we make a number of plots. Three of these are produced
by :code:`dynesty` and users should consult the
`relevant documentation <https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html>`_
for those. (We note that we produce a checkpoint trace with the unit hypercube
samples in addition to the default :code:`dynesty` plots.)

Finally, we produce a :code:`"stats"` plot as shown below.

.. image:: images/stats-plot.png

The panels here show:

* The number of likelihood evaluations per iteration. The sampling here used
  the :code:`act-walk` method and so the flat portions of the curve correspond
  to points that come from the same MCMC exploration. We can clearly see that
  in this case, the sampling became much more efficient after 4000 iterations,
  most likely due to the allowed prior region becoming unimodal at this point.

* The number of accepted steps per MCMC chain per iteration. Before the MCMC
  evolution begins, this number is 1 and after the sampling stops, the final
  value is repeated in the plot.

* The number of iterations between a live point being chosen and removed
  from the ensemble of live points for the point removed at each iteration.
  This value reaches a stationary distribution after some initial warm-up
  (shown in grey) and before the final live points are removed (shown in red.)

* A histogram of the lifetimes of the blue colored points in the third panel.
  The red curve shows the expected distribution and the p value compares the
  lifetimes with the expected distribution.
