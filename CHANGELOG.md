## [0.5.0] 2019-05-08

### Added
- A plot_skymap method to the CBCResult object based on ligo.skymap
- A plot_calibration_posterior method to the CBCResult object
- Method to merge results

### Changed
- Significant refactoring of detector module: this should be backward conmpatible. This work was done to break the large detector.py file into smaller, more manageable chunks. 
- The `periodic_boundary` option to the prior classes has been changed to `boundary`.
*This breaks backward compatibility*.
The options to `boundary` are `{'periodic', 'reflective', None}`.
Periodic boundaries are supported as before.
Reflective boundaries are supported in `dynesty` and `cpnest`.

function to create trace plots during the dynesty checkpoints
- Dynesty now prints the progress to STDOUT rather than STDERR

-

### Added
- Constraint prior: in prior files you can now add option of a constraint based
on other parameters. Currently implements mass-constraints only.
- Grid likelihood: module to evaluate the likelihood on a grid

### Changed
- The GWTransientLikelihood no longer returns -inf for  m2 > m1. It will evaluate
the likelihood as-is. To implement the constraint, use the Constraint priors.

## [0.4.2] 2019-03-21

### Added
- Fermi-Dirac and SymmetricLogUniform prior distributions
- Multivariate Gaussian example and BNS example

## [0.4.1] 2019-03-04

### Added
- Support for JSON result files

- Changed the default result file store to JSON rather than hdf5. Reading/writing of hdf5 files is still intact. The read_in_result function will still read in hdf5 files for backward compatibility
- Minor fixes to the way PSDs are calculated
- Fixed a bug in the CBC result where the frequency_domain model was pickled
- Use pickling to store the dynesty resume file and add a write-to-resume on SIGINT/SIGKILL

-

- Added citation guide to the readme

## [0.3.6] 2019-02-10

### Added
- Added the PolyChord sampler, which can be accessed by using `sampler='pypolychord'` in `run_sampler`
- `emcee` now writes all progress to disk and can resume from a previous run.

### Changed
- Cosmology generalised, users can now specify the cosmology used, default is astropy Planck15
- UniformComovingVolume prior *requires* the name to be one of "luminosity_distance", "comoving_distance", "redshift"
- Time/frequency array generation/conversion improved. We now impose `duration` is an integer multiple of
  `sampling_frequency`. Converting back and forth between time/frequency arrays now works for all valid arrays.

- Improve the load_data_from_cache_file method

### Removed
- Removed deprecated `PriorSet` classes. Use `PriorDict` instead.

- Additional tutorials on using GraceDB and experts guide on running on events in open data

### Changed
- Updated repository information in Dockerfile for PyMultinest

## [0.3.4] 2019-01-10

### Changes
- Renamed the "basic_tutorial.py" example to "fast_tutorial.py" and created a
 "standard_15d_cbc_tutorial.py"
- Renamed "prior" to "priors" in bilby.gw.likelihood.GravtitationalWaveTransient
  for consistency with bilby.core. **WARNING**: This will break scripts which
  use marginalization.
- Added `outdir` kwarg for plotting methods in `bilby.core.result.Result`. This makes plotting
into custom destinations easier.
- Fixed definition of matched_filter_snr, the interferometer method has become `ifo.inner_product`.

### Added
- log-likelihood evaluations for pymultinest
## [0.3.3] 2018-11-08

Changes currently on master, but not under a tag.

- Removed unnecessary arguments (`ra`, `dec`, `geocent_time`, `psi`) from source functions and replaced them with `**kwargs` where appropriate.
- Renamed `PriorSet` to `PriorDict`
- Renamed `BBHPriorSet` to `BBHPriorDict`
- Renamed `BNSPriorSet` to `BNSPriorDict`
- Renamed `CalibrationPriorSet` to `CalibrationPriorDict`
- Added method to result to get injection recovery credible levels
- Added function to generate a pp-plot from many results to core/result.py
- Fixed a bug which caused `Interferometer.detector_tensor` not to update when `latitude`, `longitude`, `xarm_azimuth`, `yarm_azimuth`, `xarm_tilt`, `yarm_tilt` were updated.
- Added implementation of the ROQ likelihood. The basis needs to be specified by the user.
- Extracted time and frequency series behaviour from `WaveformGenerator` and `InterferometerStrainData` and moved it to `series.gw.CoupledTimeAndFrequencySeries`

### Changes
- Switch the ordering the key-word arguments in `result.read_in_result` to put
  `filename` first. This allows users to quickly read in results by filename
- Result object no longer a child of `dict`. Additionally, the list of
  attributes and saved attributes is standardised
- The above changes effect the saving of posteriors. Users can expect that
  opening files made in python 2(3) which where written in 3(2) may no longer
  work. It was felt that the overheads of maintaining cross-version
  compatibility were too much. Note, working in only python 2 or 3, we do not
  expect users to encounter issues.
- Intermediate data products of samples, nested_samples are stored in the h5
- Time marginalised GravitationalWaveTransient works with arbitrary time priors.

## [0.3.1] 2018-11-06

- More core likelihoods, Poisson, Student's-t
- Result print function fixed
- Add snr functions as methods of `Interferometer`
- The paths between imports where changed so that calls such as
  `bilby.WaveformGenerator` no longer work. Instead, we need to use
  `bilby.gw.WaveformGenerator`. This was done to keep things cleaner going
  forward (when, for example, there may be multiple wfg's).
- Samplers reorganised into individual files.

## [0.2.1] 2018-07-18

### Added
- InterferometerStrainData now handles both time-domain and frequencu-domain data

- Fixed a bug in create_time_series
- Enable marginalisation over calibration uncertainty in Inteferemeter data.
- Fixed the normalisation of the marginalised `GravtitationalWaveTransient` likelihood.
